**A collaborative clone of the Atomist website.**</br>
This was an 8 week project by a team of 3.</br>
In this version, not all pages made it into the scope of our project. Those pages will not load when selected.</br>
Parts we built: Landing page, Developer, Pricing, Navigation bar.
The focus of this project was becoming familiar with GitHub, utilizing an Agile work flow, and building a Responsive site.</br>
